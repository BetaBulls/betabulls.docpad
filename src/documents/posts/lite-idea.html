Think back when man first ventured into space. Early missions were rockets, which evolved into satellites, then animals, humans and eventually a full space station. When a skyscraper is to be built, a small scale model is built first. When a programmer codes something new, they also code a test for it to ensure it’s integrity as best the test can tell. It is the natural course of things to first be tested before being built to scale. It is natural also to be creative and think beyond miniature scales. It’s awesome to be visionary and to dream without limits, but to bring these ideas to life, a structure and process must be applied. A foundational piece of that initial process is prototype testing.

“Measure twice, cut once.” Things look different from different perspectives. What might make 100% sense in your mind might not make sense to someone else. This doesn’t mean that if someone tells you your idea won’t work that you stop there. Think of the Wright Brothers. They were even called “bluffers” for claiming they’d get a manned craft in the air. They started small, building prototype after prototype with only spruce wood, muslin fabric and modified bicycles. They tested their idea again and again, failure after failure, despite the critics. the Wright Brothers are a perfect example of taking small steps. They took things that already existed, working off previous knowledge of things they they’d already seen and experienced. They pieced together a prototype that would one day take to the sky and change our world forever.

Small steps building atop the last.
